    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses concerning the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), to describe the worst-case scenario of memory usage.</p>
